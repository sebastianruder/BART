/**
 * This sieve matches speakers to compatible pronouns,
 *
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
 * I  assigned to the same speaker are coreferent.
 * you with the same speaker are coreferent.
 * The speaker and I in her text are coreferent.
 *
 * The speaker and a mention which is not I in the speakerâ€™s utterance cannot be coreferent.
 * Two I (or two you, or two we) assigned to different speakers cannot be coreferent.
 * Two different person pronouns by the same speaker cannot be coreferent.
 * Nominal mentions cannot be coreferent with I, you, or we in the same turn or quotation.
 * In conversations, you can corefer only with the previous speaker.
 *The constraints result in causing [my] and [he] to not be coreferent in the earlier example (due to the third constraint).
